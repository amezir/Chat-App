# Chat-App

I developed a chat application using the following skills:

- Next.js to create a responsive web interface.
- Socket.io to enable real-time communication.
- Node.js to manage the server side.
- Sass for user interface design.
  
The result is a real-time chat experience with an elegant, customizable interface.
